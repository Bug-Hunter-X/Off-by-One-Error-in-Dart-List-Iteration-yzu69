# Off-by-One Error in Dart List Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Dart when iterating over a list using a `for` loop. The error arises from incorrectly handling the loop's termination condition, leading to an `IndexOutOfRangeException`.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop bounds when working with lists and arrays in Dart.
